# Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

## Resources
Read or watch:

* 3.1.3. Lists
* Data structures (until 5.3. Tuples and Sequences included)
* Learn to Program 6 : Lists
## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

## General

* What are lists and how to use them
* What are the differences and similarities between strings and lists
* What are the most common methods of lists and how to use them
* How to use lists as stacks and queues
* What are list comprehensions and how to use them
* What are tuples and how to use them
* When to use tuples versus lists
* What is a sequence
* What is tuple packing
* What is sequence unpacking
* What is the del statement and how to use it
## Requirements
Python Scripts

* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
* All your files should end with a new line
* The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)
* All your files must be executable
* The length of your files will be tested using wc

### 0-print_list_integer.py
Write a function that prints all integers of a list.

* Prototype: `def print_list_integer(my_list=[]):`
* Format: one integer per line. See example
* You are not allowed to import any module
* You can assume that the list only contains integers
* You are not allowed to cast integers into strings
* You have to use `str.format()` to print integers

### 1-element_at.py
Write a function that retrieves an element from a list.

* Prototype: `def element_at(my_list, idx):`
* If `idx` is negative, the function should return `None`
* If `idx` is out of range (> of number of element in `my_list`), the function should return `None`
* You are not allowed to import any module
* You are not allowed to use `try/except`

### 2-replace_in_list.py
Write a function that replaces an element of a list at a specific position.

* Prototype: `def replace_in_list(my_list, idx, element):`
* If `idx` is negative, the function should not modify anything, and returns the original list
* If `idx` is out of range (> of number of element in `my_list`), the function should not modify anything, and returns the original list
* You are not allowed to import any module
* You are not allowed to use `try/except`

### 3-print_reversed_list_integer.py
Write a function that prints all integers of a list, in reverse order.

* Prototype: `def print_reversed_list_integer(my_list=[]):`
* Format: one integer per line. See example
* You are not allowed to import any module
* You can assume that the list only contains integers
* You are not allowed to cast integers into strings
* You have to use `str.format()` to print integers

### 4-new_in_list.py
Write a function that replaces an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list.

* Prototype: `def new_in_list(my_list, idx, element):`
* If `idx` is negative, the function should return a copy of the original `list`
* If `idx` is out of range (> of number of element in `my_list`), the function should return a copy of the original ``list``
* You are not allowed to import any module
* You are not allowed to use `try/except`

### 5-no_c.py
Write a function that removes all characters `c` and `C` from a string.

* Prototype: `def no_c(my_string):`
* The function should return the new string
* You are not allowed to import any module
* You are not allowed to use `str.replace()`

### 6-print_matrix_integer.py
Write a function that prints a matrix of integers.

* Prototype: `def print_matrix_integer(matrix=[[]]):`
* Format: see example
* You are not allowed to import any module
* You can assume that the list only contains integers
* You are not allowed to cast integers into strings
* You have to use `str.format()` to print integers
